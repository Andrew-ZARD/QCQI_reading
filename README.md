# Wellcome to this reading! We hope every member can learn something new here and gradually make learning of qauntum related subjects enjoyable!

Preface: 
Due to perfection and improvement of hardwares and associated techniques, accuracy and fidelity steadily improve over time. Through hardworks all scientists contributed(such as quantum error correction and qauntum fualt tolerant algorithms), we are seemed to be on the tail of NISQ era. To catch on and harness such tide as a group of students whose interpretaions and notions may not be as sharp and percise as experts in related realm. We would fistly follow chapter by chapter to learn through fundamental concepts and cement solid background about qauntum information and qauntum computaion in one of the most classic and recommanded textbook which is Quantum Computation and Quantum Information 10th Anniversary Edition (Michael A. Nielsen, Isaac L. Chuang) (Z-Library). Then read and strive to understand related essays or papers to further study to the extent that can explain those ideas from most shallow to deep,in the aim to be able to practically do development or design of quantum algorithms that is actually problem-solving and of contribution to not only academia but society.

Note that each of the meeting will be recorded through OBS or any other software which is capable of completing exactly the same task. We would make them accessible on youtube or other accessible location to everyone(has not been decided yet).
